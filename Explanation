This code sets up a real-time object detection system using OpenCV and the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) model. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the main components and their functionality:

Camera Initialization: The code starts by attempting to access the webcam. If it cannot open the camera, it displays an error message and exits.

Configuration Parameters: It defines several parameters for object detection:

whT: The width and height to which the input image will be resized (320 pixels).
confThreshold: The confidence threshold for detecting objects (0.5).
nmsThreshold: The threshold for non-maximum suppression to reduce overlapping bounding boxes (0.2).
Loading Class Names: The code tries to load the class names from a file named coco.names. If the file is not found, it prints an error message and exits.

Loading YOLO Model: The YOLO model's configuration and weights are loaded from yolov3.cfg and yolov3.weights files. It also sets the preferable backend and target for the model to OpenCV.

Object Detection Function: The findObjects function processes the model's outputs:

It iterates through detected objects, extracting class IDs and confidence scores.
If the confidence score exceeds the defined threshold, it calculates the bounding box coordinates and dimensions, storing them for later processing.
Non-maximum suppression is applied to remove redundant overlapping boxes, and the final bounding boxes are drawn on the image.
Main Loop: The program enters an infinite loop where it continuously captures frames from the webcam. For each frame:

It converts the frame to a blob suitable for the neural network.
The blob is fed into the YOLO model to get predictions.
Detected objects are highlighted on the frame using the findObjects function.
The modified frame is displayed in a fullscreen window.
Exit Mechanism: The loop runs until the user presses the 'Esc' key, after which it releases the camera and closes all OpenCV windows.

Overall, the code effectively demonstrates how to perform real-time object detection using deep learning and computer vision techniques.
